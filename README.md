Homework # 2 - VBA Challenge

The goal for this homework was to create a sumarized table to highlight the yearly performance of each stock. 
The starting point was a worksheet which had the open, higher, lower and close price per day for each of the stocks.

As an additional challenge, we had to pick the stock (ticker and value) with the greater % increase, greater % decrease and the higher stock value (also per year).

Besides the readme file, I have 4 other files in this reporsitory. 3 of them are screenshots of the summarized table and the additional challenge per year and the last one is a vs code file with the VBA script used to achieve the homework goal.
